Load the data set. Incorporate Data Augmentation\n","\n","#### Dataset folder structure\n","\n","The easiest way to load you own training/test image dataset is with `datasets.ImageFolder` from `torchvision` ([documentation](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/datasets.html#imagefolder)). In general you'll use `ImageFolder` like so:\n","\n","```python\n","dataset = datasets.ImageFolder('path/to/data', transform=transform)\n","```\n","\n","where `'path/to/data'` is the file path to the data directory and `transform` is a sequence of processing steps built with the [`transforms`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/transforms.html) module from `torchvision`. **More about this below**. ImageFolder expects the files and directories to be constructed like so:\n","```\n","root/dog/xxx.png\n","root/dog/xxy.png\n","root/dog/xxz.png\n","\n","root/cat/123.png\n","root/cat/nsdf3.png\n","root/cat/asd932_.png\n","```\n","\n","where each class has it's own directory (`cat` and `dog`) for the images. The images are then labeled with the class taken from the directory name. So here, the image `123.png` would be loaded with the class label `cat`. \n","\n","You can check that the provided dataset has the required structure.\n","\n","#### Data augmentation\n","\n","A convolutional neural network that can robustly classify objects even if its placed in different orientations is said to have the property called invariance. More specifically, a CNN can be invariant to translation, viewpoint, size or illumination (Or a combination of the above). \n","\n","A common technique to enforce the invariancy of the CNN and obtain a more robust classifier is [Data Augmentation](https://medium.com/nanonets/how-to-use-deep-learning-when-you-have-limited-data-part-2-data-augmentation-c26971dc8ced), which seeks to train the neural network with additional synthetically modified data, generated by introducing randomness in the input data itself. For example, you can randomly rotate, mirror, scale, and/or crop your images during training. This will help your network generalize as it's seeing the same images but in different locations, with different sizes, in different orientations, etc. We do this by defining a torchvision `transform`, and you can learn about all the transforms that are used to pre-process and augment data, [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/transforms.html)\n","\n","This type of data augmentation should add some positional variety to these images, so that when we train a model on this data, it will be robust in the face of geometric changes (i.e. it will recognize a ship, no matter which direction it is facing). It's recommended that you choose one or two transforms."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xp-52daGeFaj"},"source":["\n","To randomly rotate, scale and crop, then flip your images you would define your transforms like this:\n","\n","```python\n","train_transforms = transforms.Compose([transforms.RandomRotation(30),\n","                                       transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224),\n","                                       transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),\n","                                       transforms.ToTensor(),\n","                                       transforms.Normalize([0.5, 0.5, 0.5], \n","                                                            [0.5, 0.5, 0.5])])\n","```\n","\n","You'll also typically want to normalize images with `transforms.Normalize`.
